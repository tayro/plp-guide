# Assigning a Project
To assign a project navigate to the 'Assign' page. You’ll see that the 'Assign' tab is highlighted as well as the menu item for 'Assign Project'.

Next, select the students you would like to assign the project to. You’ll see all the sections that you teach listed. You can select all of the students in each section by just selecting the checkbox next to the section. If you instead want to select only some students in a section, you can expand the section by clicking the arrow to the right and selecting specific students.

When selecting a step, you have the option of attaching Google Docs to every student’s steps.The PLP uses the file you select as a template, making copies for each student that you selected. These google docs will be linked to from the student view, and this is where student's will input their work. For more details on selecting files see this article: Project Assigning: How to Change Files for Steps and Performance Tasks

Finally, you have the option of adding resources to your students’ project libraries. You can do this by selecting the individual resources specific to each project. Note that if the resource if a Google document, all students will be linked to the same Google doc. Unlike project steps, resource files are not created unique for each student. Details on creating project resources can be found here: Project Authoring.

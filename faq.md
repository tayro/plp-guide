# Assigning Projects

### Why can't I delete a project step or performance task?

We do not allow you to remove project steps or performance tasks if the project is currently assigned to students. The issue is if you have assigned this project to 50 students, then delete a project step, its not clear what should happen if for example a student has already started working on that step.

In order to delete project steps or performance tasks you will first need to unassign this project from all students.

#### Workarounds
When you assign a project you don't have to assign all project steps -- so one easy thing to do if you don't want to unassign the project but also don't want to include all project steps, is to just not assign this particular step to students. You can read more about this in this how-to guide: Project Assigning: How to Assign a Project

Also, you can always change the google docs associated with project steps or performance tasks, even after assignment. If all you want to change is the google doc you won't need to unassign the project from all students.


### How long does it normally take to create files for an entire class in the PLP?

The PLP individually creates google documents for each and every one of your students. Although computers are fast, it does take some time to create each file. Thus, we encourage everyone to create files for students the night before you need it.



### What is the difference between a default project file and a custom project file?

A default project file is attached on the Project Overview page. This file will automatically be the default for students on the Assign page. You can also select individual students on the Assign page and choose to instead give them a custom project file. The main use by teachers for custom project file is to give heavily scaffolded project steps to students based on student performance data.



### What happens with google docs when I assign steps/tasks/resources? Why aren't student google docs updating when I update the original?

When you assign a project step or a performance task to a student, a copy is made of the original google doc. So let's say you have google doc A which is the original, then you assign the project step to a student. When you do this, the PLP will create a brand new google doc (let's call it google doc B), which is an exact copy of google doc A.

However, google doc A and google doc B are not tied together in any way after the copy is made. That is, if you later go and change google doc A (the original), google doc B will not be changed.

So if you need to change students' google docs after assignment, you will need to update this in the PLP. This is detailed in this how-to guide: Project Assigning: How to Change Files for Steps and Performance Tasks

This is not the case for project resources. All students will be linked to the same project resource - so if you later update the original project resource document, it will update for all students.



### Where do student google docs live?

When you assign performance tasks or project steps to students and copies of google docs are created, these google docs live in the assigning teacher's google drive. There should be folder in your google drive called "Student PLP Work". If you click into this you will see a folder for each project you have assigned. If you click into the folder for the particular project, all of the student google docs should be in there.

Note that normally you shouldn't have to sort through this folder as all of the documents are linked to from the PLP -- it is the little blue file icon you see on the 'Give Scores' page.



### Who are student Google Docs shared with?

When you assign performance tasks or project steps to students and copies of google docs are created -- the intention is that those google docs are visible to the student and every teacher at your school.

You can see who this google doc is shared with by clicking into a student's google doc, and clicking on the blue 'Share' button in the upper right corner of the google doc.







This will bring up a dialog -- click 'Advanced' in the lower right corner of this dialog.





This will bring you to a page which details exactly who the document is visible to. It should be visible to a google group which includes all the teachers at your school.



### What types of Google docs can I assign as project steps / performance tasks?

The only types of documents that you can attach to project steps and performance tasks are Google docs, Google sheets, and Google slides.

Word documents, excel files, powerpoint presentations, pdf's and Google forms will NOT work.

The issue is that Google drive only allows the PLP to make editable copies of certain document types.

There is a workaround. If you put a Word document into Google drive (just drag it onto the screen), and then click on the Word document - Google drive will show you a preview of the document. At the top of the preview there is a little button that says "Open." If you click this, a Google doc will automatically be created which is a copy of your Word doc. You can then assign this new Google doc to students.







# Grading Projects

### What is the difference between an orange and red wrench?

Students are able to self-assess whether they are on (check) and off track (wrench) for a project step and teachers are able to provide feedback for students on whether they are on (check) and off track (wrench). We wanted to make sure to delineate between a teacher’s assessment and a student’s assessment.

Orange wrench = student’s self-assessment of progress on a project step
Red wrench = teacher’s assessment of a student’s progress on a project step. Student cannot change this assessment to “complete” without the approval of a teacher


### I gave my students cognitive skill scores on the Give Scores page but student don't see any change to the scores on their Grades page - Why?

The PLP will not compute scores from the Give Scores page until a teacher has marked the step with "Final Results". All other options will allow you to include a score but the score will not be calculated into the overall grade.

*Tip - You can use this feature to give students formative assessment scores during the course of the project without it influencing their overall grade.







# Content Assessments

### How long does a student have to take a Content Assessment?

The testing window is 90 minutes.



### Is there a way to track exactly which questions a student answered incorrectly?

The PLP provides data to students at the objective level but not at the individual question level. To access this data "Act as" a student and click on the content assessment in question.



### What might cause a test to invalidate?

A student's content assessment attempt can be marked as invalid for a few reasons:

They did not start within 10 minutes of being approved
They did not finish within the time allotted (which they can see in the top right corner while they are taking the assessment)
They click away from the assessment, for example back to the playlist
Their teacher clicks "Deny" on the assessment approvals page.

### How do I add students into the PLP?

We are pulling your student accounts from your Student Information System via Clever. Thus, once your SIS is updated with your student’s enrollment information, the student will receive an account in the PLP the following instructional day. Please note that you will need to submit a parent consent form for every new student.



### How do I change the course a student is enrolled in?

Because we are pulling you student accounts from your Student Information System via Clever the first step is updating your SIS. Once your SIS is updated the PLP will update via one of two mechanisms. Some schools have an auto-sync established that runs every night which means that you'll see changes the following day. Other schools have established a manual sync which means that once your SIS is updated you'll need to file a request for us us to run a manual sync - you can file this request via ZenDesk.
